# Perunidad Website

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **Perunidad** website. The project was developed to support the association's mission of promoting education and sustainable development in disadvantaged regions of Peru.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two parts:

1. **The Public-Facing Website**
   - Accessible to the public.
   - Includes information about the projects, ongoing actions, and allows visitors to make donations.
   - The source code for this part is published here on GitHub.

2. **The Internal Management Platform**
   - Reserved for members of the association.
   - Enables the management of internal data such as staff planning, recruiting process and ongoing actions.
   - **The source code for this part is not available in this repository** for confidentiality reasons.

## Project Status

This version of the **Perunidad** website is no longer live, as the management and development of the site have been taken over by the next team. The source code here reflects the work done during the time it was maintained by our team.
